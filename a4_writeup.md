# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The has won function as it's kind of hard to understand 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
We could define a function called bot where it has already premade moves made with if statements since it's a more simple game than like chess, and the moves made would be based on like if they're starting or if they have an X/O on the cener of the board. 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
We might implement a learning based AI that records what moves a certain person makes and how they respond to certain moves and optimize what the best path is to beat that person through enough trials.
